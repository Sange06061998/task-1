With the object model, JavaScript gets all the power it needs to create dynamic HTML:
•	JavaScript can change all the HTML elements in the page
•	JavaScript can change all the HTML attributes in the page
•	JavaScript can change all the CSS styles in the page
•	JavaScript can remove existing HTML elements and attributes
•	JavaScript can add new HTML elements and attributes
•	JavaScript can react to all existing HTML events in the page
•	JavaScript can create new HTML events in the page
